# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 
In this milestone, using variable called word_list, I was able to create a list of words using 5 favourite fruits as an example.

I was also able to use the input and random built-in module.

# Create a list containing the names of your 5 favorite fruits.

# Assign this list to a variable called word_list.

# Print out the newly created list to the standard output (screen).

#def list of fruits as word_list
word_list = ["banana","apple","oranges","pears","watermelon"]
print (word_list) 




name= input("enter single letter")
#name = guess
guess=input("enter single letter")

#create an if statement that checks if the length of the input is equal to 1 and the input is an alphabet.

# In the body of the if statement, print a message that says "Good guess!".

# Create an else block that prints "Oops! That is not a valid input." if the preceeding conditions are not met.

import random


#pass word_list into choice
word_list = ["banana","apple","oranges","pears","watermelon"]
word = random.choice(word_list)
print(word)
print(word_list)


guess = input("can you guess a letter")
if len("guess")==1 and guess.isalpha():
    print("good guess")   
else:
    print("Oops! That's not a valid input.")
